                    At Del Porto we are more than just a restaurant. We are a gathering place where tradition meets modern Italian style. Once known as Manoloâ€™s and proudly featured in The Sopranos, we have grown into a neighborhood favorite with deep roots in the community and a fresh exciting culinary vision.
